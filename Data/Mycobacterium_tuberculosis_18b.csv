Rv2755c,hsdS.1,Implicated in restriction/modification of DNA. Component of type I restriction/modification system. It's possible that the M and S subunits together form a methyltransferase (MTASE) that methylates two adenine residues in complementary strands of bipartite DNA recognition sequence.
Rv3052c,nrdI,Unknown. Probably involved in ribonucleotide reductase function.

Rv3443c,rplM,Involved in translation mechanism. This protein is one of the early assembly proteins of the 50S ribosomal subunit.
Rv3924c,rpmH,Involved in translation mechanism. This protein is one of the early assembly proteins of the 50S ribosomal subunit.
Rv2441c,rpmA,Involved in translation mechanisms.
Rv2904c,rplS,This protein is located at the 30S-50S ribosomal subunit interface and may play a role in the structure and function of the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site.
Rv2890c,rpsB,Involved in translation mechanism.
Rv2889c,tsf,Associates with the EF-TU.GDP complex and induces the exchange of GDP to GTP  it remains bound to the aminoacyl-tRNA. EF-TU.GTP complex up to the GTP hydrolysis stage on the ribosome.
Rv2534c,efp,Involved in peptide bond synthesis. Stimulate efficient translation and peptide-bond synthesis on native or reconstituted 70S ribosomes in vitro. Probably functions indirectly by altering the affinity of the ribosome for aminoacyl-tRNA  thus increasing their reactivity as acceptors for peptidyl transferase.
Rv2839c,infB,If-2  one of the essential components for the initiation of protein synthesis in vitro  protects formylmethionyl-tRNA from spontaneous hydrolysis and promotes its binding to the 30S ribosomal subunits. It is also involved in the hydrolysis of GTP during the formation of the 70S ribosomal complex.
Rv3460c,rpsM,Involved in the binding of fMet-tRNA and  hence  in the initiation of translation.
Rv2785c,rpsO,Involved in translation mechanism. This protein is one of the 16S ribosomal RNA binding proteins.
Rv2442c,rplU,Involved in translation mechanisms.
Rv2055c,rpsR2,Involved in translation  amino-acyl tRNA binding
Rv3459c,rpsK,S11 plays an essential role for the selection of the correct tRNA in protein biosynthesis. It is located on the large lobe of the small subunit.
Rv2362c,recO,Involved in DNA repair and RECF pathway recombination
Rv2736c,recX,May play a regulatory role possibly by interacting with RECA  the product of the upstream ORF.
Rv1317c,alkA,Involved in the adaptive response to alkylation damage in DNA caused by alkylating agents. Repairs the SP diastereomer of DNA methylphosphotriester lesions by a direct and irreversible transfer of the methyl group to one of its own cysteine residues. The methylated ALKA protein acts as a positive regulator of its own synthesis  as well as that of other proteins.
Rv2761c,hsdS,Implicated in restriction/modification of DNA. Component of type I restriction/modification system. It is thought that the M and S subunits together form a methyltransferase (MTASE) that methylates two adenine residues in complementary strands of bipartite DNA recognition sequence.
Rv3715c,recR,May play a role in DNA repair. It seems to be involved in an RECBC-independent recombinational process of DNA repair. It may act with RECF|Rv0003 (and RECO|Rv2362c ?) for modulating assembly of disassembly of RECA filaments.
Rv3687c,rsfB,Regulates negatively Rv3287c|RSBW|USFX. Possibly regulated by phosphorylation.
Rv1365c,rsfA,Regulates negatively Rv3287c|RSBW|USFX. Regulated by redox potential.
Rv2838c,rbfA,Associates with free 30S ribosomal subunits (but not with 30S subunits that are part of 70S ribosomes or polysomes). Essential for efficient processing of 16S rRNA. May interact with the 5'terminal helix region of 16S SRNA.
Rv2836c,dinF,Function unknown; induction by DNA damage.
Rv3223c,sigH,Alternative sigma factor that plays a role in the oxidative-stress response (regulation of thioredoxin recycling). The sigma factor is an initiation factor that promotes attachment of the RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and then is released. This sigma factor is involved in heat shock and oxidative stress response; it is believed to control protein processing in the extracytoplasmic compartment. Regulates positively DNAK and CLPB genes. Regulates TRXB2  TRXC  Rv2466c and SIGB genes  and probably SIGB gene. SigH may mediate the transcription of at least 31 genes directly and modulates the expression of about 150 others.
Rv3053c,nrdH,Involved in electron transfer system for ribonucleotide reductase system NRDEF.
Rv2528c,mrr,Involved in the acceptance of foreign DNA which is modified. Restricts both adenine- and cytosine-methylated DNA.
Rv3458c,rpsD,This protein binds directly to 16S ribosomal RNA.

Rv2919c,glnB,In nitrogen-limiting conditions  when the ratio of GLN to 2-ketoglutarate decreases  P-II is uridylylated to P-II-UMP by GLND|Rv2918c. P-II-UMP allows the deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase (gs)  thus activating the enzyme. Converserly  in nitrogen excess P-II is deuridylated and promotes the adenylation of gs. P-II indirectly controls the transcription of the gs gene (GLNA: four copies in the genome). P-II prevents NR-II catalyzed conversion of NR-I to NR-I-phosphate  the transcriptional activator of GLNA. When P-II is uridylylated to P-II-UMP  these events are reversed.
